#syntax for variable names in python - a comment
# the name of a variable shouldn't start with a numerial (number 1-9 example-- 1space)
#the name of a variable shouldn't start with any symbol(#, $, @ ,%, )
#don't leave space with compound variable names or names with more than one word ( in sucg a case , use _ e.g pay_as_you_earn or carmel notion e.g payAsYouEarn )
#use relatable variable names or words(e.g tax name for PayAsYouEarn)
# it's recomended to start a variable with small letters(e.g salary)
# any variable name  should have a value  (while declaring a variable  we should initialise it e.g salary = 1000)
#try to use shorter variable names (e.g sal to mean salary)
#python is case sensitive
